# Project

## Project Overview

The final project is to present and summarize one machine learning theory paper, in a team of two. Each of you has been assigned a teammate, a paper, and a date for presentation, based on alphabetical order of last names (mostly, with some individual requests on dates taken into account). The project includes two parts:

- (30%) an in-class joint presentation on the assigned paper, on the assigned date.

- (30%) a joint final report that summarizes the assigned paper, due on 12/17 (submit through Brightspace; no late day is allowed).
