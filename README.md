## Description

This [course](https://haipeng-luo.net/courses/CSCI678/2024_fall/index.html) focuses on the theoretical foundation of machine learning. The first half of the course is devoted to the fundamentals of statistical/online learning and the core question: what determines the sample complexity of learning? The second half of the course focuses on algorithm design for sequential prediction problems, especially for those that require learning under limited feedback. A concrete schedule can be found [here](https://haipeng-luo.net/courses/CSCI678/2024_fall/schedule.html).
